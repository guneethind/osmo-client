- **dji-vcam** by razboy — <https://github.com/RB14/dji-vcam> — MIT License. How the Action series'
  live view is started and kept alive (registration with the video encoder, the trigger and the 200 ms
  heartbeat) and the video cursor of the status packets follow that project's protocol notes. No code
  from it is included here. Its license: MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 razboy, with the same
  permission notice and disclaimer as quoted above for osmosis.

- **osmo_nano_webcam** by Matis-ard — <https://github.com/Matis-ard/osmo_nano_webcam> — showed how
  the Osmo Nano's live view can be received over Wi-Fi. No code from it is included here.

- **OpenPocketCine** and **OpenCine** by Erik Sutton and contributors —
  <https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine> — Apache License 2.0 (Copyright 2026 Erik Sutton and
  OpenPocketCine contributors). The live view's picture header and private SEI, the exposure
  compensation, image, timelapse and storage commands, and the monitoring tools' algorithms and constants
  (false color bands, zebra and focus peaking thresholds, scope layouts, the .cube LUT layout), the Osmo
  Pocket support (session, H.265 live view, gimbal and zoom commands, the Osmo Pocket 3's formats and
  gallery) and Multiview's approach (each extra camera on a shared network, a shared record command
  confirmed per camera) follow that project's code and documentation. No code from it is included here.
