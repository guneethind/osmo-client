"""Osmo Client: control a DJI Osmo camera from the computer over Wi-Fi (unofficial).

Opens a local page (http://127.0.0.1:8091) with the live view, the camera's capture modes, a shutter
(photo or record, depending on the mode), exposure and format settings, the full camera status, and a
gallery to preview the camera's files and download them to the computer.

How it connects: Bluetooth LE to find, pair and wake the camera (the first time it asks to approve
"OSMO" on its screen) and to read the password of its Wi-Fi access point; then the computer's Wi-Fi joins
that access point and everything else runs over it. Keep internet on another adapter (Ethernet) while
connected. "Disconnect" on the page, or Ctrl+C here, puts the computer's Wi-Fi back on its own network.
Or the camera joins a Wi-Fi network the computer is on (a router, or the computer's hotspot) and the
computer finds it there: set it per camera on the page (Cameras).
